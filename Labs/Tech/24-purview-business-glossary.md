Plan how to launch and maintain a business glossary in Microsoft Purview across multiple business units.

---

## Instructions

1. **(5 minutes)** Choose 2 departments (e.g., Finance and Sales) and list 5–10 terms each team commonly uses.

2. **(10 minutes)** Define for each term:
   - Business definition
   - Sensitivity level (e.g., Public, Confidential, Restricted)
   - Example classification (e.g., PII, Financial, Operational)

3. **(10 minutes)** Discuss how glossary terms will be governed:
   - Will ownership be centralized or federated?
   - Who approves new terms?
   - How will definitions be kept up to date?

4. **(5 minutes)** Prepare a summary of your glossary rollout strategy:
   - Governance structure
   - Sample terms with definitions and classifications
   - How you'll ensure adoption and avoid duplication

## Deliverable

Each group presents a glossary governance plan with sample terms, classification examples, and a maintenance strategy.
